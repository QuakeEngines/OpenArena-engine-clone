To be fixed before releasing to Google Play:

Sniper mode should aim where you've pointed crosshair before, not at the center of the screen
Railgun should shoot shoot when you release your finger, so you can aim precisely
Custom railgun crosshair, that will change color while reloading
It does not draw any helping hint about multitouch controls
Two aiming modes to configure - swipe-free and swipe + fire button
Center view button will act like swim up when inside water
In-game chat is not working
You cannot change player name
Set up at least one dedicated server
Create a video, with explanations about how the controls work

Scheduled for the next major release, when it will reach at least 10k downloads:
